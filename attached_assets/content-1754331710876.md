Here is the react boilerplate I’m trying to make from scratch.
I have bundled html with the react code but I’m not able to add styles (CSS).
I have heard about ExtractTextPlugin but not able to configure it.
Please suggest some way to add styles to it.

Thank you in advance.

- Probably, you need to look at `node-sass` plugin

You need to use style-loader and css-loader in your **webpack.config.js**

First, install these two packages via npm:
`npm install style-loader, css-loader --dev`

Then, create a **styles.css** in your `src` folder and append the following styles into the file (just for demo purpose, so you know it's working correctly):

```hljs css
body {
  background-color: #ff4444;
}

```

Don't forget to import the css file in your **src/index.js**:

```hljs javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App.js';
import './styles.css'; // <- import the css file here, so webpack will handle it when bundling

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));

```

And use style-loader and css-loader in your **webpack.config.js**:

```hljs javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [\
      {\
        test: /\.js$/,\
        exclude: /node_modules/,\
        use: { loader: 'babel-loader' },\
      },\
\
      {\
        test: /\.css$/,\
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],\
      },\
    ],
  },

  plugins: [\
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\
      template: './src/index.html',\
    }),\
  ],
};

```

If you don't see the correct output, you might need to restart the webpack dev server again. I have cloned your repo and made the changes like I mentioned above, it works.

As for `ExtractTextPlugin`, you will need this when bundling for a production build, you can learn more from their [Repo](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin)

Hope it helps!

Hi Chirag `ExtractTextPlugin` works great but when it comes to caching and bundle hashing. Css bundle becomes **0 bytes**. So they introduced `MiniCssExtractPlugin` which has tackled this issue. It is really important to cache static files as your app size increase by time.
import plugin first:

```hljs javascript
var MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");

```

add these in your webpack config:

```hljs css
rules: [\
\
   {\
      test: /\.js$/,\
      exclude: /node_modules/,\
      use: {\
        loader: 'babel-loader'\
      }\
    },\
    {\
      test: /\.scss$/,\
      use:  [  'style-loader', MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']\
    }\
  ]
}
plugins: [\
  new MiniCssExtractPlugin({\
    filename: 'style.css',\
  }),\
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\
    template: './src/index.html',\
  }),\
\
```\
\
Let me know you the issue still persists.\

- Can you tell me why did you added a filename option to HtmlWebpackPlugin ?\

\
- By default webpack writes HTML to index.html but in case we have to specify different directory to inject index.html then we specify filename\

\
- Because my build directory is outside the src directory. You don’t have to customise it.\

first you need to load style-loader and css-loader.Then you will add the following code in "rules" in webpack.config.js file.\
\
```hljs perl\
{ test: /\.css$/,use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']}\
\
```\
\
then import the "style.css" file location into the "index.js" file and for example:\
\
```hljs coffeescript\
import "./style.css";\
\
```\
\
When you package, "css" codes will be added in "bundle.js".\
